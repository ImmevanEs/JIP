For the technical analysis of tidal converter NEMO by ArianeGroup a code was conducted to simulate the system as a multi-body system to find an estimation for the performance. In the Multibody simulation tidal converter file the main script can be found that explains the implementation and set up. The one arm simulation file contains the code analysing just one arm with two blades to eventually find the optimal pitch of the blades as a function of the azimuth angle. The power vs V file loops over TSR and V to find optimal relations between power, velocity and tip speed ratio as well as finding an estimation for the power. Furthermore, the simulation was done with just one blade per arm which can be read in the power vs V for one blade file. Finally, a analysis on structural integrity was done for the frame of the arms which can be seen in the file static forces and moments with angle of attack. 

If there are any further questions on the code, the JIP team would be happy to help you.
